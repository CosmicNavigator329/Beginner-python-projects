# Beginner-python-projects
# 🐍 Python Learning Path & Web Development Prep 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to my personal coding repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress and storing projects as I advance my knowledge in Python, with the ultimate goal of transitioning into web development (specifically using frameworks like Django or Flask).

This repository serves as a **Portfolio of Progress**—a chronological record of concepts learned and applications built.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The projects are organized into folders based on complexity and focus:

| Directory | Focus Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01-Beginner-Scripts` | Core Fundamentals | Basic scripts, variable manipulation, control flow (loops, conditionals), and basic I/O. |
| `02-Intermediate-Concepts` | OOP & Structures | Projects focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures (lists, dictionaries), exception handling, and external file operations. |
| `03-Data-Analysis-Prep` | Libraries & Data | Introduction to key libraries like Pandas or NumPy, basic data cleaning, and small analysis projects. *(Lays groundwork for backend data handling)*. |
| `99-Web-Prep` | Future Focus | Placeholder for initial steps into web development (e.g., small Flask 'Hello World' apps, HTML/CSS practice). |

## 💡 Goals

My current learning path and goals for this repository include:

1.  **Master Python Fundamentals:** Achieve fluency in core programming concepts.
2.  **Learn Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Apply efficient coding practices in practical projects.
3.  **Explore Frameworks:** Begin small projects using **Flask** or **Django** to understand routing, templates, and database interaction.
4.  **Build a Full-Stack Project:** Eventually use this knowledge to create a functioning web application.
